            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lords and Gentlemen, &amp;c. I beseech you be not abashed to see and behold me raised againe from the dead in the world. Sith the sighes and teares of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate friends and seruants, and the slaunders of my vngratefull Enemies, haue broken vp my Tombe, and my poore soule, violently drawne from his rest, by those cruell executioners, hath entred againe into my body, with it to yeeld vnto France, the last motions of my affection, whereof death had bereaued it. Alas, I feare, and am in great doubt, that my admonitions will proue as vnprofitable as charitable, and that his voyce, which proceedeth from heauen, is giuen vnto me, but onely to make your faintnesse vnpardonable, and your complaints vnlawfull and needlesse, when your destruction shall
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:173815:3"/> fall vpon you. How often and many times haue you beene told and forewarned of the mischiefes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series which you feele, and the wholsome and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary remedies thereof offered vnto you, which you haue not onely refused and despised, but to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary haue iniured and persecuted those whom you had called to ayde you, and whom you had summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and warned to vse their Art and vocations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: Which hath beene done by a most iust and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret iudgement of God, who as the Physician, that is able to heale all sicknesses and diseases, did best know the cause of your malady, and gaue you the readiest and fittest meanes that might be found. He hath dealt with the three flower Deluces of France, as with those that were sice of an ouer great aboundance of wealth and blood, and to euery on eof them hath perticularly applied a feminine Horse-leach, which alwayes suck and draw, and neuer is full, nor satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by reason of an infinite number of little ones that loyue with them, and which stand behind at the taile, and receaue that which others sucke from the head.</p>
            <p>At this day, God giueth you a meanes by your weaknesse, and continuall Feauers, to know and perceiue the ouer-great euacuation of your blood, and treasures, and that th every best and purest blood and treasure that you haue. Therefore watch care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and not diligently, for the conseruation of that small remnant which remaineth, and lay hold vpon the remedies that may serue to recouer your health and strength againe: without flattery acknowledge it, and without feare or any doubt of your further
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:173815:3"/> mischiefe, and of the causes and aduantages which your Enemies hold on: consider the debased and weake state, first by the dissipation of the great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the same, and then by the youth, superstition, faint-heartednes, persideousnes, or deuision amongst the Princes thereof, which make the Nobility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come carelesse of their Zeale towards their Country, and the common people benummed, and as it were sencelesse of the mischiefes and forces thereof, and all of them together moued with enuie, to runne and labour of see which of them shall first fall into the net. The onely cause of all these disorders and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, is the horrible ambition of <hi>Luynes,</hi> and his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, who for the establishing of his tyrainnie, hath fully determined, after he hath deuoured all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of France, layd and heapt it vp, in the surest pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and whole Prouinces which he vsurpeth, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, flattered, and corrupted, the most part of the Princes, and great personages, and imbased, cast downe and disgraced those whom he could not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, to vse the meanes and interest of strangers, to aduance his tyrannie, by declaring Warre against those, of whom, for the good of the State, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to aske peace.</p>
            <p>The aduantages which he hath already had, and which he further expecteth, are great, if hee be not preuented. First, he hath giuen colour to an infinite number of new Edicts, Proclamations, imburse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, imprests, impositions, exactions, and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which the greatest tyrants in the world neuer imagined nor thought of, he hath caused those to be executed, which he introduced the last yeare, vnder
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173815:4"/> pretence of making Warre against the Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and which the Parliament, as the Eccho of the peoples sighes, had refused to ratifie and confirme, and I cannot imagine how those Edicts should be become more iust and lawfull this yeare; If not, but that by the executions of the same, God hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to punish France, for suffering them to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed: by this meanes then he hath bereft France of her last iuice, and from thence hath drawne two speciall and principall commodities: The first, that he hath fortified himselfe, and brought France into an extreame necessity. The second, that he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and drawne the peoples hearts vnto a reuolt, and to a generall disunion.</p>
            <p>Againe, hee heapeth, and that with great appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that this Warre will deliuer and free him from all those that esteeme his tyrannicall resolutions, to be dangerous, and that hee shall be the principall heire: Therefore you see, that he hath giuen the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of his first disordered Armies (not to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates and trusty friends) but onely vnto those, who at other times opposed themselues against the progresse, &amp; issue of his tyrannie, whom he distrusts, and by their blinde courage, longeth to be rid of them, his last Armies, which beare for a deuice: The manifestation of his tyrannie, hee conferreth vnto those that shall be his partners, and shall order them best: and in the meane time, he leaueth the office of a Constable, like an ignorant Physician without mercy, putting his owne people like poore soules in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hospitalls.</p>
            <p>Againe, he hopeth so conueniently to abuse both
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173815:4"/> the Kings authority and forces, that after a long time of Warre, and misery, both parties shall be so weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and yet so much animated, that they cannot any more hurt him, nor ioyne together to resist his tyrannie: he hath also made a good entrance, (and if he be suffered to continue) a yeare longer, I am assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he will manifest himselfe. First, by the issue of two sieges, and hauing deuided the Army to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, sending part thereof to lie before Rochell, he drew the King himselfe in person, with the rest, to lie before Montaubon, which against all millitary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he would besiege, and against the season of the yeare, and the aduice of all the world, vnlesse it were of <hi>Pater Arnoux,</hi> who payd the Captaines and the Souldiers onely with miracles, and reuelations: he hath wearied the Army, without paying them any money to liue vpon, and without any order, that the poore sicke or wounded Souldiers might be relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with bread and water, in such manner, that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and sicknes hath killed many more of them, then the Enemy hath done, and expresly left their dead carksses lying aboue ground without buriall, to the end, that the putrifaction of them might infect the ayre, and ingender a plague, which was the cause that the Souldiers dispairing, ranne through the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and there robd and spoyled Trauailers and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that they met in the high wayes, whose poore Wiues and Children cry vnto God for vengeance against <hi>Luynes</hi> and his adherents, and for a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of all the rest, after that with so long headstrongnesse, hee had lost more men, then the King had done in three battailes, hee was forced (to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:173815:5"/> the great preiudice of the Kings authority) which till then had neuer failed, to raise his siege, and in the Kings name in submissiue manner to desire a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full peace, of those, who on their knees ought to haue asked the same of him. Thus you see the notable functions of the Constables office, and the effects of the happy conduction and successe which he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by his Letters. And in the meane time, that all these great disorders and necessities happened, with a great fire at his backe; hee stood and played 1000. pistolets and French crownes at Dice, vpon a Table after Dinner: he neuer went neere the fight, but he made it come vnto him, and neuer went further for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (but onely by his sight) hauing a Corselet of of prospectiue glasse betweene: he motioned a small Truce or ceasing from Armes for two houres long, that he might goe to visite the Trenches, alwayes bearing the monster Feare in his pocket, least hee should stay longer there: he caused great conuoyes of money to be sent from Paris, vnder pretence of paying the Souldiers in the Army, but the greatest part thereof stayed in Blaye: euery day he caused 600. men to worke at Lisigny, as many at Quillebouef, 800. at Amies, 500. at Calais, and more then 200. in <hi>Luynes</hi> places in Paris, euery man for 20. Solz a day, and 500. men in Garrison in Amiens, for the keeping of one part of his treasure, all ordained as if it had beene for the King, and payd them as it were with blood: in the meane time, poore France suff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, she tares her owne entrailes in pieces; shee is dismembred by these disorders, which are as many seeds of partialities, and of Common-wealthes, as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173815:5"/> there are strong places of Hugonites, that is the point whereunto <hi>Luynes</hi> aspireth, for coadiutors and conspirators in his designes, hauing the auncient Enemies of the State, who for the space of 100. yeares, haue sought and aduanced the dissipation of the State, by all the meanes they can deuise, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by the superstitions which both day and night they sowe in weake consciences: their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Ministers are <hi>Arnoux</hi> and <hi>Rousselay,</hi> who abuse the Kings conscience, as <hi>Luynes</hi> abuseth his affection. In <hi>Luynes</hi> they say there is iustice and agillity, in esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of his tyrannie: they pronounce and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise him prosperity, from the Popes secret chamber of Cardinals, and from the Conclaue: they assure him, that the dissipation of this State being effected, the Enemy will leaue him the principall Manour, and the right of eldership: these are things which heretofore were offered to those of our house, whose hearts were neuer capable of so pernicious a designe. Since that time the Enemies ambition hath no more diminished then the inuention of his Ministers: those are they, who by their treasons and secret practises, haue made the entrance into this pleasing Warre, thereby to lull the people asleepe, and so with more applause to bring all the State into dissipation. First, hauing bereft it of all alliances; and it is likely, that if the patience of Rench men doth continue, they will soone attaine to the end thereof, &amp; place <hi>Luynes</hi> on the top of the wheele: he hath already gotten all the treasures of the Realme, which are the Sinnowes of an estate, both in peace and warre: he hath yet of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:173815:6"/> late within foure moneths space layd vp aboue two millions of Franckes, he hath all the Pensions giuen since three yeares past, all the Kings debts which are not discharged, he hath diuers whole Prouinces, all the best places in others, he seekes to haue Prouince: If he can in exchange of Guyenne, whereby he may haue the charge of the Generall of the Gallies, hee hath beene dealing with the places which <hi>Chastillio</hi> holdeth, that therewith hee may speedily pretend something against <hi>Langnedor,</hi> and the Admiralty, and by that meanes both by Sea and land on all sides of France, bring in all sorts of Strangers, to assure himselfe against the naturall Patriorts, by new Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, after the manner of the Romanes; he hath the King on his side, whose nature he hath so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised, that he hath perswaded his Maiestie, that it is not enough to loue him, if he doe hate himselfe. I cannot refraine to speake of a point of most strange arrogancie, which he hath done besides all the rest; whereof I haue made mention, which is, that the King loued an auncient Musitian, that had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally serued aboue 25. or 30. yeares, both the King his Father deceased, and himselfe, and had for a reward giuen him, before other sutors, a Canons place voyd in the holy Chapell of Paris, for the which he was determined to giue him his Letters Patents. This poore man, as his manner was, being gone to the Kings Masse at Piquecox, <hi>Luynes</hi> presented a man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King, and said: Sir, here is a man to whom you must giue a Canons place, which is vacant in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chapell in Paris: to whom the King said, I haue
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:173815:6"/> giuen it already to such a man, naming the Musician who as then was there: <hi>Luynes</hi> replyed, and said, Sir, you must giue him somewhat else, and content this braue man, who will doe you good seruice. The poore Musician that stood behind, therewith could not refraine from speaking and weeping, but spake as loud as he could, and said: My Lord, I pray you hinder mee not from that which it hath pleased his Grace to bestow vpon mee, it is the recompence of 25. yeares seruice: the King hath giuen it willingly vnto me, that I might passe my old dayes in praying vnto God both for his Maiesties prosperity and yours: wherewith his Maiestie moued to pitie, said vnto <hi>Luynes,</hi> My Lord Constable, I pray you hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let him haue it; It is long time since I promised the same vnto him, and I gaue it him without asking. But <hi>Luynes</hi> arrogancie was so great, that neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the Kings request, nor the Musicians teares: after he had imposed filence vnto them both, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Letters Patents to be made for the same to him, whom he intended to gratifie. By this it is easie to iudge, whether such dealings sauour not rather of a proud arrogant Commaunder, then of an humble seruant. It euidently appeareth, that the Kings great losses, are <hi>Luynes</hi> great gaines, the King hath lost all his treasures, Luynes hath gotten them, and of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernments and strong places may be said the like: it may be he will say, that whatsoeuer hee hath is the Kings, and particularly his places: but I say, it is farre from that, he seeth the necessity and disorder in the Kings affaires for want of money: he hath great
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:173815:7"/> treasure, but doth not ayde the King therewith: that is a signe, that hee hath robbed the King, and that which he hath, his Maiestie knoweth not of, for it is not to be doubted: but if the King had giuen it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, hee would be ashamed to see his Maiestie want, and not restore him a small part of that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which he had giuen him. And touching his pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and gouernments, he hath too well shewed, that they are no more at the Kings disposition: euery man knowes, that the last yeare, he would not suffer his Maiestie to enter into the Citadell of Amiens, with aboue sixe persons besides himselfe. Hath not the King also receiued a great losse, by the death of so many braue men before Montaubon: to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Luynes</hi> hath lost but so many feares, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained many assurances; and now hile he is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what out of breath, and perceiueth that the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the Catholicks seeme to beat against him, in regard of the notable actions of a Lord high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable that hee hath persormed: hee makes shew to seeke for his protection among the Hugonits, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diminish the courages both of the one and the other, by his treoheries and deceites: and so hauing breathed himselfe, to begin some other practises: hee doth like the Wcauer, that casts his Shuttle on both sides too and fro, to weaue his cloath; hee fisheth on all sides, as well in cleare as troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: those who this day thinke themselues to be his friends, the next day hee makes them his Enemies, and when hee will, makes his Enemies his friends, for the benefit of his affaires: whereunto hee makes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:173815:7"/> account that all things are subiected, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the King, or of heauen: hee is perswaded that neither the King, the Queenes, the Princes, the Lords, the Gentlemen, nor the people; no, nor yet that which is impossible, can be any obstacles to his designes. Touching the King, I haue said somewhat already: concerning the Queene Mother, it is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and incredible vnto those, that haue not seene it: hee caused himselfe to be followed to the Armie, and in all other places by that Princesse, as long as it pleased him, like a Carrabin, alwayes bound to the Pack, till at last, teares, shame, and remorce of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science hauing ouercome him, hee graunted her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, vpon condition to be alwayes ready, to walke, stay, or guide her, where and in what manner so euer hee would, hauing first bereft and depriued her, as he thought, of all the Princes and great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages that held with her, so that he feareth nothing on that side. For Monsieur the Kings brother, hee hath him in his possession, hee gulls him continually, and causeth him to be gulled by others: And to set a colour vpon the straight Guard which hee holdeth about him, hee hath wickedly supposed, that hee should haue beene carried away to Granado; and which is more, hee hopeth that his tyrannie will be established before the lawfull age of that Prince be accomplished.</p>
            <p>Touching the Prince of Conde, hee assures him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that promising him some Archbishopricke, or the Maiors place in Burges, or causing him peaceably to enioy the Office of the Bayliwick of Berry, or of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:173815:8"/> some such like thing, or of the most, giuing him a present of 100000. Franckes, that he will cause him to doe whatsoeuer hee will: yea, and if it be 10 re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne his degree and quality of the first Prince of the blood, and to consent to his tyrannie. The poore Prince is much abused, to put his trust and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in <hi>Rousselay,</hi> to make him beleeue that he is a good Catholick: he shall neuer obtaine that credit, vnlesse he and his sonne both become Monkes, for many reasons that I know. <hi>Luynes</hi> is somewhat more afraid of the County, he is a young orientall sprig, who as yet hath not abused any man, or lost his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: hee groweth in age of strength and authority, and begins to draw many mens hopes vnto him; and further, as yet he is not prisoner, he is stiffe and vnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to be bowed: it concernes him to preserue his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and that good opinion which is conceiued of him, specially in his first action, for that is it, whereby he shall be the better esteemed of, all his life long. All the rest of the Princes and great persons, <hi>Luynes</hi> makes no account of, commaunding and vsing them like his seruants, or rather like dogs: he driues, calls, and turnes them backe againe, when he pleaseth, with a beck of his hand, and they are happy, if in all their voyage, they may but once enter into his outward Chamber, and as he passeth by, receiue a kind nod with his head for their congie, or benediction: hee saith he hath accustomed them thereunto, and that he feares them not, and boasts that hee hath corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, deuided, and so much altered, all their credites among the Nobility, that at this day, there are few
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173815:8"/> Gentlemen that speake not euill of all the Princes, and which vtter not their opinion sof the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As all these greatnesses (Gentlemen) are as many fore-runners of his tyrannie, they also seeme to thrust forward, and prouoke his ambition to proceed further, for his owne security: hee should be very blinde, if he were perswaded, that the successour of our king (whom God graunt long to raigne) would not finde his greatnesse to be odious, and vnseemely in the State, and that hee would not vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and abate it. The great mischiefes which he hath done, and the great treasure which he vniustly possesseth, will continually put him in this feare, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till such time as that he hath assured himselfe, and that for his assurance, he sacrificed the greatest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the State, which are the mightiest obstacles against him, hee could be content that they would sacrifice themselues (as I haue done) at his insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>The Traytor as he is, knoweth how he hath told me a hundred times, at the least, that in this Warre, he would haue no other recourse but vnto mee, and but two dayes before my death, comforting me for the death of some of my friends, said vnto me, that if he might attaine to the winning of Montaubon, he would doe me so much good, and giue me so good contentment, that I should haue no minde nor cause to weepe for the losses, that I had receiued: and yet neuerthelesse, at the time of my death, he could not refraine from reioycing thereat, together with his confederates, as a thorne puld out of their hearts,

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:173815:10"/> and to make my death the lesse lamentable, and my memory dishonourable: presently after the same, he falsly and trayterously supposed certaine factions and intellgiences to be practised and knowne by me, to the preiudice of the Kings seruice, and his State, and restrained some of my seruants, imprisoned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, bereauing them all of the meanes of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, vnlesse they would yeeld to a scandalous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position against me. Is not all this manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding a sufficient proofe of his trecherie, and of the designe that he had to worke my decay. Traytor as thou art, hadst thou neede of sacrifices of such qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities? and yet if thou wouldest haue beene content with the losse of my life, without seeking to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the memory of me: thou shouldst haue told the King (thereby to haue lessoned his griefe) that I had done ill seruice to his Maiestie, and therein thou hadst said true: but it is to be vnderstood, that it was, because I did not venture to lose my life, to bereaue thee of thine: my Tombe thereby would haue bin more honourable then it is, and my fidelity would neuer haue bin assayled by the slaunders: my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse would haue bin much more, and my memory more apparant. Thereby I should haue stayed the continuall murmurings of many millions of soules, which thou hast raised against the Kings bounty: I had saued the ruine and death of aboue 100000. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whom thou onely hast caused to perish in sixe moneths space, by plague, famine, and fire. And you my Lords, &amp;c. to whom I direct my speech, will you yet draw vpon your selues, so many murthers,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:173815:10"/> plagues, famines, and other miseries? Doe you not heare the voyce of innocent blood, which cries out, and saith, That your impious patience, or rather, your negligence, and faint-heartednes, are most great crimes before God, and that you are the murtherers of those, whom you defend not from perishing, and that as you should haue bin the murtherers of others, you shall also most assuredly be murtherers of your selues, and certainely the greatest fauour that some of you shall obtaine, is, that you shall be the last that shall be deuoured.</p>
            <p>Were it not better then, that you should ioyne your affections, your courages, and that force which as yet you haue resting, altogether to saue and defend your selues from this Shipwrack, and rather drowne your Enemies therein. It may be, that you my Lords, the Princes, and great men of the State will say, that this coniunction is impossible, because of the infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or diuision which is amongst some of you, and that so it would be vnprofitable and in vaine; in as much as you should not bee seconded by the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the people would cry out against you. It is most true, that your infidelity formerly past, and committed, hath much deuided and altered your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: but now, when you perceiue and know the domage and hurt that this infidelity hath done vnto you, and the great good from the which it withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you. Set vpon him, that is the Author thereof. Is it to bee said, that a man should neuer leaue nor cease from sinning, and that your consciences should neuer stirre nor moue you to repentance, specially
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:173815:11"/> at this day, when euery one of your Honours liues and goods, are interressed therein: haue we not seene affections more seperated, to be reioyned and vnited againe, thereby to oppose and withstand a common Enemy: Dogs doe the same against Wolues, to saue their Flockes, and children against strangers to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue their owne houses: doe it then to defend your troupes, and your houses; and in a word, to saue that, for the which you striue, and are deuided amongst your selues; If not, then heereafter doe not pretend that there is any life, dwelling, state, quality, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or good whatsoeuer resting to be striuen for in France, I see no other way of safety for you: It is not slight, vertue, nor faint heartednesse that can saue you; I cannot see any hope otherwise of an honest and honourable death. If the onely griefe that a man can doe nothing in this respect, doe not cause the most couragious and best beloued of God, to die for sorrow, that so they may not bee left as a prey, to <hi>Luynes</hi> tyrannie, and the obiect of his cruelty.</p>
            <p>And you famours Nobility, that haue obtained your great priuiledges, for hauing three times, one after another beene the fundamentall stones of this State, cimented with your blood: Infinite times the protections of our Kings, bridles against the vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Strangers, spurres to pricke you forward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all tyrannies, can, or would you degenerate and become so faint-hearted, as to abandon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of your vertues, so dearely wooen and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for a prey to your Enemy: Suppose that a new Tyrant alwayes hateth and feareth those that haue
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:173815:11"/> seene the beginning and birth of his Tyrannie, and that are able to reproue him for the same. It is much, if the children that are borne vnder it, may be sure of their liues. <hi>Luynes</hi> fearing you, were very simple, if hee would not bee cruell against you. Then with a good will, and couragious hearts: follow the good motion sof your Princes and great States men: I know that many of them haue abused you, and haue much cooled the heat of your zeale: but let not that hinder nor withdraw you, in this worthy occasion, to ioyne with them for the preseruation of your Countrey, and your selues.</p>
            <p>And you my Masters of the Comminalty, effect this last worke, for the healing of your disease, you haue done others of great moment, to procure your owne sicknesse: it is you that are lulled asleepe, with false pretences, thereby with more ease to pull the skie off from your backes: you are fed with false newes, to maintaine and support your patience, and to lay Suger vpon the long Pills of poyson, which they make you swallow downe: many of you are so sicke, that you feele not your paine, and those that feele it, thinke to ease it onely with sighes, or at the least, with some silent groanes; that is not enough, you must cry out, and that so loud, that you may be vnderstood: speake boldly, and flatter not your selues, feare not your Enemies; you cannot be worse then you are, but may rather hope for them: tell them that you haue seene your last liberty, and that now you feele the extremity of bondage, that your mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes are remedies, that it is now time or else ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:173815:12"/> to free the spirit of the King, in his state, and to pull away the foot that is ready to tread vpoon his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, drowne his Enemies in your blood. I intend not hereby, to make or incite you vnto a new Warre, or to stirre you vpo to new disorders among your selues: my meaning is cleane contrary; you ought to ioyne and reunite all your affections and interests toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vnder the good conduction of the Queene Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, she was crowned by the late King deceased, she gouerned this State in the Kings minority, none can beare greater affection to her Sonne, nor hath a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vocation in this matter, nor lesse iealousie in such authority, shee neither would nor could make any thing worse. Then altogether with one voyce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that <hi>Luynes</hi> may be called in question, to yeeld account of his gouernment, &amp; the mannaging of the Treasure: If he hath done well, his iustification can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but be honourable: If he hath done ill, he is a man subiect to the Law and to Iustice, as well now when he is Lord Constable, as then when he was but a bird-catcher: many of our Princes, and of our Queeens, haue beene brought thereunto: those that were innocent, escaped with honour, and the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable were punished: Is it not great reason, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one should yeeld an account of his actions; none but Tyrants will not hearken thereunto: our Kings (although they are bound vnto it) vse to gratifie their Subiects with their declarations: why then should hee, who as yet is not, nor neuer shall be, if it please God, refuse to appeare before the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Paris, before that honourable Senate, where
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:173815:12"/> partiality hath no place: Therein he should obtaine great titles of Nobility, which his predicessours ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had, to be iudged by their Peeres: If conscience makes him shunne and abhorre this state, and his courage perswades him, before he is accused, that he shall be ouerthrowne; he shall condemne himselfe, and so there will rest nothing for him, but onely to execute him: you haue reason and meanes to doe it by Armes, he shall neuer escape Iustice, for she will triumph ouer him, God will hinder him from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himselfe from the Law, and from the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for the which he hath reserued him: Assure your selues, that his conscience it selfe which hath failed him in his pernicious designes, will also faile him in bringing him to his punishment. And doe not stay the vengeance of God, and his Lawes, with so wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked an offering, which is not sufficient to appease him: you must also extend it, euen vnto all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipants and executioners of his designes, and first his two brethren, referre the entire execution of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Parliament: let it re-edifie the Piramides that is falne downe, and driue away those plagues and cuill Cankers of the State. Those Tyrants of mens spirits, and consciences, which euery day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a thousand tyrannies into France, and would make our Kings and our liberties Slaues and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to Strangers, and our Citizens murtherers (I dare not say of whom) in regard of the Ecclesiasticall Caracter. Call to minde and remember, that the King, when the Marshall d'Ancre died, said, that then he began to raigne: If you deliuer his Maiestie from

Is it possib good which cannot be sonne enough concei execution should be defened to my part, altheough I an but a Ghost, forrie, for not hauing conibuted thereunto. Therefore now I will with all speech to assaile and torment his courage and their in pieces with all and friends.</p>
